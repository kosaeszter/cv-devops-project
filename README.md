# DevOps Infrastructure Project

This is a **work-in-progress DevOps project** where I am experimenting with cloud infrastructure and automation.  
The goal of this project is to build a **scalable, secure, and fully automated environment** using Terraform, including networking, databases, and other cloud resources.  

⚠️ **In Progress!** The project is under active development, (and my DevOps studies are still ongoing) ⚠️

## Project Highlights
- Infrastructure as Code with **Terraform**
- AWS resources like **VPC, subnets, security groups, and RDS**
- Focus on **modularity, scalability, and best practices**

## Tech Stack (current status)
- **IaC Tool:** Terraform  
- **Cloud Provider:** AWS  
- *(More tools and services will be added as the project evolves)*

## Note
This project is ongoing and continuously evolving.
